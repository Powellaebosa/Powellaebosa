<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Network Engineering Projects:</h2> - <b>Cisco IOS Upgrade on Router 0</b>


‚úÖ Identified a newer IOS version from Cisco‚Äôs database (simulated environment).
‚úÖ Verified Router0‚Äôs hardware compatibility (DRAM/Flash) for the upgrade.
‚úÖ Downloaded the new IOS image and placed it on a local server in the Packet Tracer topology.
‚úÖ Confirmed Router0 had enough Flash memory to store the new IOS.
‚úÖ Used FTP protocol to securely transfer the IOS image from the server to Router0.
‚úÖ Performed an MD5 hash check to ensure file integrity and prevent corruption.
‚úÖ Configured the boot system command to make the router boot from the new IOS version.
‚úÖ Scheduled the upgrade after hours (best practice) to reduce downtime.
‚úÖ Reloaded the router to complete the upgrade and verified successful boot. - https://youtu.be/kzUrZd6Sh2Q?si=PVd1g-NcMK_68jfx
